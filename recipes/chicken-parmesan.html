        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A popular dish in Italian-American restaurants, this makes sure the chicken is nice and crispy instead of soggy in a pile of sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>salt and pepper for seasoning</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
            <li>2 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil(frying)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mozzarella</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated provolone</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. 
                Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. 
                Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. 
                The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. 
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. 
                Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
